## Design
### Overall Feel

For this page I wanted a modern industrial look in a combination of white and gray. to make the page look more elegant

### Colour Scheme

While white is the main colour for the site and will be itilized as much as possible, I chose gray colours that I thought would not be overwhelming and add an elegance to it. 

### Typography

I chose the [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=Nunito) font for the all site.

### Imagery

The imagery throughout the site will be primarily dictated by the products for sale.

However, I chose photos of wine that are very popular in Croatia and thus tried to introduce people to Croatian wine production.

Due to too large file all images are processed in [TinyPNG] (https://tinypng.com/).

## Wireframes and Initial Design

As the project progressed, some element placement was tweaked and updated. However, I think that the layout changes were not so drastic that they warrented new wireframes to be designed. You can find it [here]().
